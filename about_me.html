            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, I've spent all of my 34 years (and counting) here. As the second oldest of five children, I've developed a strong sense of responsibility and a close bond with my family. I’m dedicated to setting a positive example for my siblings, emphasizing values like integrity, perseverance, and personal growth.</p>
            <p>In my early years, I discovered a passion for health and fitness, which has been a core part of my life. I’ve always been active, participating in sports like football, wrestling, and track. These experiences taught me resilience, discipline, and teamwork—qualities I carry into every aspect of my life.</p>
            <p>I initially pursued a career in the medical field, spending two years at Phoenix College. While I ultimately decided it wasn’t the path for me, the experience fueled my interest in health and well-being, which remains a priority in my daily life. I continue to challenge myself, whether through fitness goals, personal development, or new learning opportunities.</p>
            <p>My journey has led me to explore diverse interests, including technology, creative pursuits, and even financial markets. Each step has broadened my perspective, and I look forward to bringing my unique blend of skills, passion, and adaptability to new endeavors.</p>
